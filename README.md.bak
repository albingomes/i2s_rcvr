# i2s_rcvr
Inter-IC Sound (i2s) receiver

Hardware (FPGA) implementation of I2S receiver 

IO:

1. clk        : system clock 
2. bck        : bit clock - 12MHz 
3. reset_n    : global reset active low
4. lrck       : indicates channel
5. data       : audio serial data input
6. data_out   : 24 bit parallel audio data out synced to system clock (clk)

Architecture: 

1. Incoming data stream passes through shift register
2. Two separate storage arrays used for left/right channel data storage
3. Edge detection of cannel select signal
4. Clock domain crossing through double flopping (bit clock: bck to system clock: clk)  
   Resource reused since single channel data avaiable for bck cycles*24
   
Tools:

1. Xilinx Vivado 2021.2
2. Device targeted: TBD
